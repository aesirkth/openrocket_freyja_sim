__NOZZLE__





Injector Discharge COefficient (no idea)
~ 0.66
ideal mass flow rate / real mass flow rate
Paper from stanford, Freyja uses the exact/similar injector geometry

Oxidizer temperature: Depends, filling process different temperature than temp we start with
Maybe start w/ 21 deg C, but it might be lower irl.

N2O doesnt behave like an incompressible fluid, saturated state.

Expected Oxidizer mass or fill%
fill% usually 85-90%

C* Ideal performance of propellant, how fast it will be ejected in ideal conditions.
Thrust multiplier, depends on factors like what fuel we burn, etc
~0.9-0.95
C* Is actually the combustion efficiency, the nozzle efficiency is the conversion of pressure to thrust

O/F Ratio? 3.5 sounds fine for now? 3.9 mentioned on Slab. 4 is the target

Leave standard values, 0.995/0.970


"Volume m^3 without grain"

Temperature. 280K to 295K?




29.7mm throat diameter
57.4mm exit diameter
36 holes - Injector
1.5mm diameter per hole
grain outer diam 109.75mm
grain inner diam 38.9
length ~306


1kg payload, NOT the fusion360 model

important to have mass properties
